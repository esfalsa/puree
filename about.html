    Lily
  </li>
  <li>
    Embassies are open or requested (not closing or rejected) with the Black
    Hawks, the Brotherhood of Malice, Valle de Arena, Red Front, or Plum Island
  </li>
  <li>
    Regions with a regional officer position named "Raider Unity", "Thorn1000",
    "JOIN TBH", or "Join %%Lily%%"
  </li>
  <li>Regions meeting these criteria but whitelisted are:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Suspicious, the Black Hawks, the Brotherhood of Malice, Lily, and Osiris
